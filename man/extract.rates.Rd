\title{Extract Risk Free Rate and Dividend Yield}
\description{
  \code{extract.rates} extracts the risk free rate and the dividend yield from European options.
}
\usage{
extract.rates(calls, puts, s0, k, te)
}
\arguments{
  \item{calls}{market calls (most expensive to cheapest)}
  \item{puts}{market puts (cheapest to most expensive)}
  \item{s0}{current asset value}
  \item{k}{strikes for the calls (smallest to largest)}
  \item{te}{time to expiration}
}
\details{
  The extraction is based on the put-call parity of the European options.  Shimko (1993) 
  - see below - shows that the slope and intercept of the regression of 
  the calls minus puts onto the strikes contains the risk free and the dividend
  rates.
